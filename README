This project is an environment simulator for ambient assisted living. 

It follows a systems dynamics approach in which it should be simple to validate the parts to be able to study emerging properties.

It is based on extended finite state machines with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation. It follows the principles of immutability of event occurrences and strong typing.

The plan is to integrate it into Eclipse to provide an environment for the specification.
